## Vessel densities in the Belgian part of the North Sea

### Introduction

In this exercise we want to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on vessel densities in the Belgian Part of the North Sea and the Western Scheldt, by using vessel densities from [EMODnet Human activities](https://www.emodnet-humanactivities.eu/).

### Results
See the online result of the analysis here:  https://vlizbe.github.io/Vessel_route_densities/

### Publication
This analysis is used in following policy information note (BIN) from Flanders Marine Institute:

### Reproducibility
You can re-run the full analysis in an RStudio environment by clicking on the button below.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vlizBE/Vessel_route_densities/master?urlpath=rstudio)

This will open an online RStudio environment (thank you Binder!). To run the analysis, open the 'index.Rmd' file.
In this file, you can run separate code chunks or click on the 'knit' button to recreate the html file
(this will take a while, and open a pop-up window).
You can also edit the code and run your own analysis.

If you have any issues with running the analysis, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/vlizBE/Vessel_route_densities/issues).
